# Nutrino

## Project Scope
Nutrino is an app developed for Android, written in Kotlin.

Users are able to create dietary profiles which includes information such as diet type (vegetarian, pescatarian, etc.) along with food intolerances.

Users can then search for recipes that match their dietary profiles, and users can add all the ingredients required for recipes into a shopping list
for their next trip to the grocery store.
